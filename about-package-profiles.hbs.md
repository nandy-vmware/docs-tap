# Components and installation profiles for Tanzu Application Platform

This topic lists the components you can install with Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).
You can install components as individual packages or you can install them using a profile containing
a predefined group of packages.

## <a id='TAP-packages'></a> Tanzu Application Platform components

- **[API Auto Registration](api-auto-registration/about.md)**

  When users deploy a [workload](workloads/workload-types.hbs.md) that exposes an API, they want that API to automatically show in
  Tanzu Application Platform GUI without requiring any added manual steps.

  API Auto Registration is an automated workflow that can use a supply chain to create and manage a
  Kubernetes Custom Resource (CR) of type `APIDescriptor`. A Kubernetes controller reconciles the CR
  and updates the API entity in Tanzu Application Platform GUI to achieve automated API registration
  from workloads. You can also use API Auto Registration without supply chains by directly applying
  an `APIDescriptor` CR to the cluster.

- **[API portal](https://docs.pivotal.io/api-portal)**

  API portal for VMware Tanzu enables API consumers to find APIs they can use in their own
  applications.

  Consumers can view detailed API documentation and try out an API to see if it meets their needs.
  API portal assembles its dashboard and detailed API documentation views by ingesting OpenAPI
  documentation from the source URLs. An API portal operator can add any number of OpenAPI source
  URLs to appear in a single instance.

- **[API Scoring and Validation](api-validation-scoring/about.hbs.md)**

  API Validation and Scoring focuses on scanning and validating an OpenAPI specification.
  The API specification is generated from the [API Auto Registration](api-auto-registration/about.hbs.md).
  After an API is registered, the API specification goes through static scan analysis and is validated.
  Based on the validation, a scoring is provided to indicate the quality and health of the API specification
  as it relates to Documentation, OpenAPI best practices, and Security.

- **[Application Accelerator](application-accelerator/about-application-accelerator.md)**

  The Application Accelerator component helps app developers and app operators create application
  accelerators.

  Accelerators are templates that codify best practices and ensure that important configurations and
  structures are in place. Developers can bootstrap their applications and get
  started with feature development right away.

  Application operators can create custom accelerators that reflect their desired architectures and
  configurations and enable fleets of developers to use them. This helps ease operator concerns about
  whether developers are implementing their best practices.

- **[Application Configuration Service](application-configuration-service/about.hbs.md)**

  Application Configuration Service provides a Kubernetes-native experience to enable the runtime
  configuration of existing Spring applications that were previously leveraged by using
  Spring Cloud Config Server.

  Application Configuration Service is compatible with the existing Git repository configuration
  management approach.
  It filters runtime configuration for any application by using slices that produce secrets.

- **[Application Live View](app-live-view/about-app-live-view.md)**

  Application Live View is a lightweight insight and troubleshooting tool that helps application
  developers and application operators look inside running applications.

  It is based on the concept of Spring Boot Actuators.
  The application provides information from inside the running processes by using
  endpoints (in our case, HTTP endpoints). Application Live View uses those endpoints to get the
  data from the application and to interact with it.

- **[Application Single Sign-On](app-sso/about.md)**

  Application Single Sign-On enables application users to sign in to their identity provider once
  and be authorized and identified to access any Kubernetes-deployed workload. It is a secure and
  straightforward approach for developers and operators to manage access across all workloads in the
  enterprise.

- **[Bitnami Services](bitnami-services/about.hbs.md)**

  Bitnami Services provides a set of services for Tanzu Application Platform backed by
  corresponding Bitnami Helm Charts.
  Through integration with [Crossplane](crossplane/about.hbs.md) and
  [Services Toolkit](services-toolkit/about.hbs.md), these Bitnami Services are immediately ready
  for apps teams to consume, with no additional setup or configuration required from ops teams.
  This makes it incredibly quick and easy to get started working with services on Tanzu Application Platform.

- **[Cartographer Conventions](cartographer-conventions/about.hbs.md)**

  Use Cartographer Conventions to ensure infrastructure uniformity across workloads deployed on
  the cluster. Cartographer Conventions provide a way to control how applications should be deployed
  on Kubernetes using a convention. Use Cartographer Conventions to apply the runtime best practices,
  policies, and conventions of your organization to workloads as they are created on the platform.

- **[cert-manager](cert-manager/about.hbs.md)**

  cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types to Kubernetes clusters.
  It also helps you to obtain, renew, and use those certificates. For more information about
   cert-manager, see the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs).

- **[Cloud Native Runtimes](cloud-native-runtimes/about.hbs.md)**

  Cloud Native Runtimes for Tanzu is a serverless application runtime for Kubernetes that is based on
  Knative and runs on a single Kubernetes cluster. For information about Knative, see the
  [Knative documentation](https://knative.dev/docs/).

- **[Contour](contour/about.hbs.md)**

  Contour is an ingress controller for Kubernetes that supports dynamic configuration updates and multi-team ingress
  delegation. It provides the control plane for the Envoy edge and service proxy. For more information about Contour, see
  the [Contour documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.22.0/).

- **[Default roles for Tanzu Application Platform](authn-authz/overview.md)**

  This package includes five default roles for users, including app-editor, app-viewer, app-operator,
  and service accounts including workload and deliverable. These roles are available to help
  operators limit permissions a user or service account requires on a cluster that runs Tanzu
  Application Platform. They are built by using aggregated cluster roles in Kubernetes role-based
  access control (RBAC). Default roles only apply to a user interacting with the cluster by using kubectl and Tanzu CLI.

- **[Crossplane](crossplane/about.hbs.md)**

  Crossplane is an open source, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project built on the
  foundation of Kubernetes.
  Tanzu Application Platform uses Crossplane to power a number of capabilities, such as dynamic
  provisioning of services instances with [Services Toolkit](services-toolkit/about.hbs.md)
  and the [Bitnami Services](bitnami-services/about.hbs.md).

- **[Developer Conventions](developer-conventions/about.hbs.md)**

  Developer conventions configure workloads to prepare them for inner loop development.

  It’s meant to be a “deploy and forget” component for developers. After it is installed on the
  cluster with the Tanzu Package CLI, developers do not need to directly interact with it.
  Developers instead interact with the Tanzu Developer Tools for VSCode IDE Extension or
  Tanzu CLI Apps plug-in, which rely on the Developer Conventions to edit the workload to enable
  inner loop capabilities.

- **[Eventing](eventing/about.hbs.md)**

  Eventing for VMware Tanzu focuses on providing tooling and patterns for Kubernetes applications to
  manage event-triggered systems through Knative Eventing. For information about Knative, see
  the [Knative documentation](https://knative.dev/docs/).

  The main role of this source management component is to provide a common interface for artifact
  acquisition.

- **[Learning Center](learning-center/about.md)**

  Learning Center provides a platform for creating and self-hosting workshops. With Learning Center,
  content creators can create workshops from markdown files that learners can view in a terminal
  shell environment with an instructional wizard UI. The UI can embed slide content, an integrated
  development environment (IDE), a web console for accessing the Kubernetes cluster, and other custom
  web applications.

  Although Learning Center requires Kubernetes to run, and it teaches users about Kubernetes,
  you can use it to host training for other purposes as well. For example, you can use it to train
  users on web-based applications, use of databases, or programming languages.

- **[Namespace Provisioner](namespace-provisioner/about.hbs.md)**

  Namespace Provisioner provides an easy, secure, automated way for Platform Operators to provision
  namespaces with the resources and proper namespace-level privileges needed for developer workloads
  to function as intended.

- **[Service Bindings](service-bindings/about.hbs.md)**

  Service Bindings create a Kubernetes-wide specification for communicating service
  secrets to workloads in a consistent way.

- **[Services Toolkit](services-toolkit/about.hbs.md)**

  Services Toolkit is responsible for backing many of the most exciting and powerful
  capabilities for services in Tanzu Application Platform. From the integration of an
  extensive list of cloud-based and on-prem services, through to the offering and discovery of those
  services, and finally to the claiming and binding of service instances to application workloads,
  Services Toolkit has the tools you need to make working with services on Tanzu Application Platform
  simple, easy, and effective.

- **[Source Controller](source-controller/about.hbs.md)**

  Tanzu Source Controller provides a standard interface for artifact acquisition and extends the
  function of [Flux CD Source Controller](fluxcd-source-controller/about.hbs.md).
  Tanzu Source Controller supports the following two resource types:

      - ImageRepository
      - MavenArtifact

- **[Spring Boot conventions](spring-boot-conventions/about.hbs.md)**

  The Spring Boot convention server has a bundle of smaller conventions applied to any Spring Boot
  application that is submitted to the supply chain in which the convention controller is configured.

- **[Spring Cloud Gateway](spring-cloud-gateway/about.hbs.md)**

  Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes is an API gateway solution based on the open-source
  Spring Cloud Gateway project. It provides a simple means to route internal or external API requests
  to application services that expose APIs.

- **[Supply Chain Choreographer](scc/about.md)**

  Supply Chain Choreographer is based on open-source [Cartographer](https://cartographer.sh/docs/).
  It enables app operators to create preapproved paths to production by integrating Kubernetes
  resources with the elements of their existing toolchains, such as Jenkins.

  Each pre-approved supply chain creates a paved road to production. It orchestrates supply chain
  resources, namely test, build, scan, and deploy. Enabling developers to focus on delivering
  value to their users. Pre-approved supply chains also assure application operators that all code in
  production has passed through the steps of an approved workflow.

- **[Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller](scst-policy/overview.md)**

  Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy is an admission controller that allows a cluster operator
  to specify policies to verify image container signatures before admitting them to a cluster. It
  works with [cosign signature format](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#quick-start) and allows for
  fine-tuned configuration of policies based on image source patterns.

- **[Supply Chain Security tools for Tanzu - Scan](scst-scan/overview.md)**

  that Application and DevSecOps teams can incorporate earlier in their path to production.
  This is an established industry best practice for reducing security risk and ensuring more
  efficient remediation.

- **[Supply Chain Security Tools - Sign (Deprecated)](scst-sign/overview.md)**

  Supply Chain Security Tools - Sign provides an admission controller that allows a cluster operator
  to specify a policy that allows or denies images from running based on signature verification
  against public keys. SCST - Sign works with
  [cosign signature format](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#quick-start) and allows for fine-tuned
  configuration based on image source patterns.

- **[Supply Chain Security Tools - Store](scst-store/overview.md)**

  Supply Chain Security Tools - Store saves software bills of materials (SBoMs) to a database and
  enables you to query for image, source, package, and vulnerability relationships.
  It integrates with SCST - Scan to automatically store the resulting source
  and image vulnerability reports.

- **[Tanzu Application Platform GUI](tap-gui/about.md)**

  Tanzu Application Platform GUI lets your developers view your organization's running applications
  and services. It provides a central location for viewing dependencies, relationships, technical
  documentation, and even service status.
  Tanzu Application Platform GUI is built from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's project
  Backstage.

- **[Tanzu Application Platform Telemetry](telemetry/overview.hbs.md)**

**Tanzu Developer Tooling:** refers to the developer conventions that enable debugging
and Live Update function in the inner loop.

**Extended Scanning Coverage:** When building container images with the Tanzu Build Service, the Cloud Native Build Packs used in the build process for the specified languages produce a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).  Some scan engines support the enhanced ability to use this SBOM as a source for the scan. Out of the Box Supply Chain - Testing and Scanning leverages Anchore's Grype for the image scan, which suppports this capability.  In addition, users have the ability to leverage Carbon Black Container image scans, which also supports this enhanced scan coverage.

>**Note:** Different scanners may have different limits. See [Supported Scanner Matrix for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](scst-scan/scanner-matrix.hbs.md).
